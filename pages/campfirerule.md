# The Campfire Rule

Always leave things better than you found it. It's a camp saying,
but it applies to most things.

When you work on a code base with 5, 10, 100 or more other engineers, you are
writing a living document. That means if you don't take care of it, the project will die.

A lot of newly minted software engineers are ready to re-write everything they
touch. Others, myself included, are timid and just want to write small fixes
on top of existing functionality (by way of far too many "if" checks). Both have their faults,
with a better approach being somewhere in the middle.

Maybe the code lacks documentation - you could do a write up.
Maybe the code is littered with anti-patterns - you could clean some up.
Maybe the libraries used are out-of-date or two slow - upgrade them.

Chipping away at technical debt isn't very glamorous. But if you do it as you go,
others will follow.
