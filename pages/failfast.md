# Fail Fast

Fail fast, but not for the reason everyone else says.

Usually, we are told to fail fast so that we can learn what doesn't work more quickly and get better at something. But I'm afraid of failure (you know, a separate can of worms), so let's re-frame the same advice so that failure becomes less scary each subsequent time.

Fail fast so you can get back to something else you love to do (proverbially hide under a blanket).

Fail fast so someone else doesn't have to.

Fail fast because you can get it right faster.
