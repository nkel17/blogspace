Distance cycled: 256 mi. Objective: Boston, MA to New York City, NY

Well, my first bicycle tour is complete! Dreamed of doing this for over a year, and after spending 
2 months planning out a route, making modifications to my bicycle, I set out.

I flew out to Boston about a week after my college graduation... and got there at 6 AM, where the bike shop that had my shipped bike didn't open until 11 AM. So I decided to take in the sights for the next 5 hours, 4 bags in tow. Lesson learned, there, could have planned that better. 

I was staying with one of my fraternity brothers that night, but decided to spend the rest of the day cycling around Boston. I visited Harvard among some other things, but really I just spent some more time fretting about my gear list. A picture of my gear lain out:

You'll soon come to find that I am horrible at remembering to take pictures. I did not capture a single landscape view of all of the beautiful things I saw on the way. I plan to fix that on my next tour though!

The first day was pretty brutal. While I pretended to train in my senior spring with a weekly mileage of a measly 50 miles, I rode 55 miles my first day. And it was 85 degrees, beating down on me all through Western Massachusetts. I ended my ride in Uxbridge MA, where I feasted after wondering what the hell I was getting myself into.

The second day was a lot more eventful, because I got to experience the hills of Eastern Connecticut. The first 20 miles I rode in the morning were heavily forested and helped me cross into Eastern Connecticut. But after that, it was all hills with little shade. 
rolling hills for hours. I started that day at 7 AM and ended at 6 PM, and I was at the time frustrated. But looking back, I rode 71 miles in a day, so I don't know what I was complaining about, really. Sometimes reality bites, as my host told me later that night. Highlight of the day: stopped at this super cute cafe called The Vanilla Bean, developed a newfound love for clam chowder, and settled on trail mix over granola bars.
I also learned that Google Maps is sometimes better at navigating than me, because I stubbornly stuck with route 44 the whole way, when I could have gone a less hilly route... I think I'll tuck that away for future use.

Speaking of which, I was in quite a need of a rest day. In Manchester, CT, I stayed with a Warmshowers host who was one of the most inspiring women I've ever met. I curse myself that I am so bad at remembering to take pictures, or I would have grabbed a picture with her. She told me about how she goes on at least three tours a year and has done so for the past twenty years! All I could think was "I just want to grow up to be you"
In my second day in Manchester, Y. took me to see Cheney Hall with a group of her classmates at the local college. Apparently, the Cheney family ran the silk trade in America and practically owned all of Manchester Connecticut in the 1800s. This building was originally a theatre, then became a library, an armory, a silk store (which many of my classmates recalled), and then finally back to a theatre. There was this beautiful organ, that, for who knows what reason, the silk store decided to drill a hole through, that was very recently restored by the members of the newfound threatre.
I ended that day teaching Y. about Indian food, mildly in shock that there was Indian food in Manchester, CT.

The next day, I marvelled at how old everything around me was. Being from Chicago, it was quite an experience to pass townlines that were incorporated in the 1600s. And also pass by three places that George Washington or Benjamin Franklin breakfasted at in whatever year they happened by. I imagine there were only so many cafes and that they had eaten at all of them. This day, I rode down the Farmington Canal Trail, which I later found out had a pretty amazing history. In 1835, the Farmington Canal was completed as a trade route that successful businessmen of the time decided would be a cheaper way to move goods. Turns out that it was more expensive to make and maintain this canal, so a decade later, they gave up, and it dried up and became a railroad instead. This railroad lasted until about 40 years ago at which point it was made into the path that it is today. It was packed! I was happy to see how much use it was getting. That day, while taking a break, a homeless man passed me by bike on some very worn out and flat tires. I flagged him down, and we chatted for a bit, as I lent him my pump and some granola bars. He was riding a lot faster with air in his tires, and he was way faster than me so he was long gone soon after. He had the biggest smile on his face.
Finally, that night, I reached Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where I stayed with a friend of a friend and watched the Cavaliers lose to the Warriors for the third time in four years. Dang.

My fourth day of riding, and fifth day in total, I rode from New Haven to Stamford. The only thing I have to say is that I passed through a lot of ports that smelled like sewage. The coastline was visually beautiful.

Finally, I rode from Stamford to Greenwich, CT, a very wealthy area with mansions the size of really big mansions... I woke up that morning with a cold, so I hopped aboard a train and popped into Manhattan about an hour later! Spent the rest of the day being a tourist and saw Central Park and a while later the High Line.

All in all, I am so glad I went on this trip, and I can't wait to go on more! I imagine I will find plenty of similar adventures in the Pacific Northwest!
